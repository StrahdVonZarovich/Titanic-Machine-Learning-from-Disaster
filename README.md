# Titanic Machine Learning from Disaster  
Solution of the Titanic Machine Learning from Disaster competition 
  
### Motivation  
Kaggle is an amazing platform to improve data science skills. Titanic Machine Learning from Disaster was my first competition and I learned a lot of thing about random forest algorithm, decision trees and preprocessing
  
### Prerequisites  
```  
Pandas
```  
```  
Sklearn  
```  
```  
Matplotlib  
```  
```  
Numpy  
```  
```  
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic  
```  
  
## Dataset  
Titanic Data Set includes 10 attribute.  
**Survived:**
Passenger survival status. 0 dead 1 alive<br/>
**Pclass:**
Class of the passenger, best metric to understand passenger economic situation<br/>
**Name:**
Name of the passenger, trivial data<br/>
**Sex:**
Sex of the passenger, very important metric<br/>
**Age:**
Age of the passenger<br/>
**SibSp:**
Siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic<br/>
**Parch:**
Parents / children aboard the Titanic<br/>
**Ticket:**
Ticket numver of the passenger<br/>
**Fare:**
Passenger fare<br/>
**Cabin:**
Cabin number<br/>
**Embarked:**
Port of Embarkation<br/>

I discarded name, ticket, cabin and embarked columns.

- Name is trivial for my model
- Cabin number data is insufficient and unorganised 
- Embarked and survival status correlation is to low
- Ticket data in unorganised

## Model  
I used the random forest algorithm. Random forest is a classification algorithm consisting of many decision trees. To "Titanic Machine Learning from Disaster" competition one of the best choices is a random forest algorithm. Sklearn RandomForestClassifier gets two hyperparameters as n_estimators and random_state. The best fit for random_state is 2. To find n_estimators I tried values between 2 to 30. The best fit is 20.
